Three Observable Trends from Analysis of the Data:

1. While there is a significantly higher number of male players, female's and other/non-disclosed spend more on average than those male players do.

2. While the bulk of the players range from ages 15 - 29. Those players in the age range 35 - 40 spend significantly more money than any other age range This could be due to older players having a high salary.

3. The 'Final Critic' is the most purchased item with the highest amount of profitability. A slight increase in the price of this item due to it's popularity would result in the best chance at an increase in profits.
