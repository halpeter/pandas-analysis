# Pandas Homework - Pandas, Pandas, Pandas

## Background

I was given access to the data for the most recent fantasy game Heroes of Pymoli.

Like many others in its genre, the game is free-to-play, but players are encouraged to purchase optional items that enhance their playing experience. As a first task, I was asked to generate a report that breaks down the game's purchasing data into meaningful insights.

I utilized Python, Pandas, and Jupyter Notebook to analyze this data.

## Observations & Analysis
* While there is a significantly higher number of male players, female's and other/non-disclosed spend more on average than those male players do.

* While the bulk of the players range from ages 15 - 29. Those players in the age range 35 - 40 spend significantly more money than any other age range This could be due to older players having a high salary.

* The 'Final Critic' is the most purchased item with the highest amount of profitability. A slight increase in the price of this item due to it's popularity would result in the best chance at an increase in profits.

* The above can be found at HeroesOfPymoli/TrendsAnalysis.md
